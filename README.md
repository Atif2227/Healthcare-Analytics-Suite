📌 Project Title - Medicare Global Healthcare Analytics Suite
Healthcare Analytics Suite is a comprehensive Power BI reporting solution designed for hospitals and healthcare organizations. The project includes interactive and customized dashboards for key areas such as In-patient (IP), Out-patient (OP), Emergency, Procedures, Surgeries, Revenue, Labs, etc. This dashboard was imbedded in a multi-tier client-server and internet-based business solution (YASASII) that serves as a Hospital Information System (HIS).
The YASASII-HIS Data is hosted in PostgreSQL database, organized into tables, views, stored procedures, etc. The reports are tailored to meet client-specific requirements, ensuring insightful and actionable analytics. This solution also involves continuous bug fixing and enhancements for optimal performance and user satisfaction.
🧠 Purpose
The Medicare Global Healthcare Analytics Suite serves as a centralized strategic intelligence hub for hospital administrators and clinical leads. Its primary purpose is to transform raw data from the YASASII Hospital Information System (HIS) into actionable insights.
By visualizing data from the PostgreSQL database, the dashboard aims to:
•	Optimize Operational Efficiency: Monitor patient throughput in Out-Patient (OP) and In-Patient (IP) departments to manage capacity.
•	Enhance Financial Oversight: Track revenue streams across different payer types and departments to identify growth opportunities and leakages.
•	Improve Clinical Quality: Analyze procedure and surgery volumes to ensure resource allocation aligns with patient needs.
•	Reduce Revenue Loss: Monitor "No Show" rates for outpatients to improve appointment scheduling and resource utilization.
📊 Features
Outpatient (OP) Performance Analytics
This module tracks the high-volume traffic of the hospital.
•	Encounters Tracking: Displays total, new, and follow-up encounters to distinguish between patient acquisition and retention.
•	Demographic Segmentation: Breaks down patient visits by gender and age groups (e.g., 25–49 is a primary demographic).
•	Provider & Specialty Ranking: Identifies top-performing doctors and departments (e.g., General Medicine and Cardiology) by encounter volume.
•	No Show Analysis: Visualizes the percentage of missed appointments by month and department to trigger corrective actions.
2. In-Patient (IP) & Admission Insights
Focuses on bed management and the severity of cases within the hospital.
•	Admission Type Profiling: Categorizes patients by IP, Day Case, or Emergency admissions.
•	Bed & Ward Management: Detailed tracking of patient counts by "Room Class" (Deluxe, Ultra-Deluxe, AC Room) and specific Nursing Stations.
•	Average Length of Stay (LOS): Analyzes the time spent in the hospital by nursing station to identify bottlenecks in discharge or care.
3. Procedures & Surgeries Intelligence
Detailed metrics on clinical interventions.
•	Procedure Volume: Tracks total procedures (e.g., Ventilator, Hemodialysis, CT Scans) and their distribution by department.
•	Surgery Metrics: Segments surgeries into Elective, Major, or Emergency and monitors the utilization of specific Operating Rooms (ORs).
•	Nationality Tracking: Understands the patient base diversity, such as Indian vs. International patients.
4. Revenue & Financial Analytics
A comprehensive view of the hospital’s financial health.
•	Revenue Breakdown: High-level cards showing Revenue With/Without VAT, Insurance Revenue, and Corporate Revenue.
•	Payer Type Distribution: Analyzes the percentage of income from Self-Pay (the largest share at 84.33%), Insurance, and Corporate accounts.
•	Category-Specific Revenue: Visualizes which services (ADT, Laboratory, Pharmacy, or specific Room Types) are the primary revenue drivers.
Dashboard Interactivity Features
•	Dynamic Filtering: All pages include slicers for Date Range, Year, Quarter, Month, Department, Specialty, and Provider, allowing users to drill down into specific data points.
•	Comparative Visuals: Uses a mix of Donut charts for market share (Payer Type), Bar charts for rankings (Top 10 Providers), and Line/Area charts for monthly trends
